## Low Level Programming :octocat:
> Each folder in this repository illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the C programming language. The file names reference the concepts
> (i.e. pointers, recursion, malloc, free, structures, function pointers, variadic
> functions, linked lists, etc) Inside these folders are files containing bash
> scripts and functions around that particular concept. Some functions are
> re-creations of functions found in the C standard libraries (i.e. _strcpy, _strlen,
> etc).

### Environment
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc version 9.3.0
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

### **Requirements**
-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
-   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl "betty-style.pl") and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl "betty-doc.pl")
-   You are not allowed to use global variables
-   No more than 5 functions per file
-   You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c "_putchar")
-   You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
-   In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
-   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `variadic_functions.h`, `main.h`, `function_header.h`
-   Don’t forget to push your header file
-   All your header files should be include guarded
